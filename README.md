This project demonstrates the development of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of two anime characters, Gon and Killua, from a small custom dataset of 30 images. Despite the limited dataset, careful preprocessing, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning allowed the model to achieve reasonable accuracy and generalization. The experiment highlights the effectiveness of CNNs for small-scale image classification tasks and emphasizes the importance of image preprocessing, regularization, and augmentation. This work can serve as a foundation for larger-scale anime character recognition projects or other custom image classification tasks.
